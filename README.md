# pydnacode

**pydnacode** is a Python module designed to assist with the construction and analysis of DNA codes using coding theory principles. It provides tools to generate, manipulate, and analyze DNA codes with an emphasis on reversible codes, weight enumerators, and more.

## Features

- **Codeword Construction**: Generate codewords based on a generator matrix.
- **DNA Code Analysis**: Analyze the properties of DNA codes, including reversible codes and weight enumerators.
- **Validation**: Ensure codewords and matrices meet specified binary and dimensional criteria.

## Installation

You can install the module usingcloce this repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muharsyad/pydnacode.git
cd pydnacode
python setup.py install
```

## Usege

Here is a quick example of how to use `pydnacod`:

```python
import pydnacode
matriks_generator = [[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],
                     [0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1],
                     [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1],
                     [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]]

code_dna = dna_code(generator_matrix=matriks_generator_1, constraints=['reverse'])
code_dna
